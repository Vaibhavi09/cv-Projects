## Introduction

This project provides an efficient solution for real-time car detection in parking lots. Leveraging the power of YOLOv5, the system can identify and track cars, helping manage parking spaces more effectively.

## Features

- Real-time Detection: Quickly identifies cars in video streams.
- High Accuracy: Fine-tuned model for precise car detection.
- Robust Pipeline: Efficient video processing with object tracking.
- Data Augmentation: Enhances model performance with diverse training data.

## Installation

Clone the repository, install dependencies, and download the YOLOv5 model weights to get started.

## Usage

Run the detection script with your video source to start detecting cars. The processed video with detected cars will be saved for review.

## Results

Sample results demonstrate the system's capability to accurately detect cars in various parking scenarios.
